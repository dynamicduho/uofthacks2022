## Inspiration
In 2020-2021, Canada alone had 2.18 million students enrolled in postsecondary institutions. As schools open to in-person classes, students will be once again studying/researching on the campuses and hosting social events as well. There is no doubt about the benefits of in-person activities and getting back to life before the pandemic, but also the dangers associated with them. However, we hope that SafeLine.ai is a means for any students, regardless of their location, to feel safe and protected while enjoying campus life!

## What it does
SafeLine.ai allows users to call their number, which connects to an AI-powered bot created by OpenAI. SafeLine.ai helps University students to feel safe when walking alone at night, either from a late-night study in the library or frequent in-person gatherings. When users download the app, they must fill in the basic information such as their date of birth, phone number and certain keywords that have alternative meanings. E.g.‘ Salvador Dalí’ = ‘911.’ The information stored about the user will be sent to the first respondent in certain scenarios.

SafeLine.ai also has the option to just say ‘911’ to call the first responders in case of an emergency or in cases of imminent threat.

## How we built it
The creation of SafeLine.ai involved the combination of Twilio, Firebase and node.js, javascript, GPT-3, HTML, CSS.

 ## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we faced was programming the script with the OpenAI and connecting it to Twilio to make the bot interactable with the human voice.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team is very proud of integrating all the sub-systems such as the AI-powered bot and the database to a well-designed user interface. Additionally, we are proud to fully execute all the points we wanted to cover and produce a product that can have positive social implications.

## What we learned
All the teammates learned technical skills related to programming and integrating systems via API. Secondly, we learned more about different platforms such as Firebase, Twilio and how they can be programmed and integrated to our needs. Lastly, we all learned more about OpenAI and AI-powered engines and other relevant knowledge in AI.

## What's next for SafeLine.ai
Future features for SafeLine.ai include location authentication, which turns it on when the user opens the app. Other features like texting and interacting with the bot via messaging would be introduced as well.
